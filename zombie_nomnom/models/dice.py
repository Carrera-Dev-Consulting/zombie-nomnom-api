"""
This module contains everything we care about when it comes to the die.
We define a class to contain the faces as well as be able to select one
using the random built-in library.

We can instatation an instance like this
```python
from zombie_nomnom.models.dice import Die, Face

custom_die = Die(faces=[
    Face.BRAIN,
    Face.BRAIN,
    Face.BRAIN,
    Face.SHOTGUN
    Face.SHOTGUN,
    Face.SHOTGUN,
])

# is currently set to None because it was not set.
custom_die.current_face 

# roll and calculate the current face
custom_die.roll()

# will be one of the faces in the in the faces array
custom_die.current_face
```

Most of the time you will want to use a preconfigured recipe
To build your dice which you can use our `create_die` method.

```python
from zombie_nomnom.models.dice import create_die, DieColor

green_die = create_die(DieColor.GREEN)

yellow_die = create_die(DieColor.YELLOW)

red_die = create_die(DieColor.RED)
```

Most of the die in the game are already pre-defined so you can expirement
and use different dice as you make your own custom games.
